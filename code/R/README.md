# R Script

Data analyses and figures were generated using the script in `teleology_shape_transform.Rmd`. `cache` contains the bayesian models that were run for experiments 1, 2 and 4. To reproduce all analyses and figures, simply fork the repository, open `teleology_shape_transform.Rproj` in RStudio, load `teleology_shape_transform.Rmd` and click `run all`.
