## Experiment 1

[Pre-registration](https://osf.io/2gebc)

In this experiment, we examined how 3 - 4 year old chidlren extend novel words and categorize at the basic level. Children were given three ojects. The first was the standard and given a novel name, such a "Zerp". Then they were shown a shape match and a taxonmic match and asked which one was a Zerp. For example, if shown a drum that is called a "Zerp", and then a same-shaped object, a foot stool, and a different shaped drum, children would be asked which one of these is a Zerp. The trials included artifacts and biological kinds. And there were three differnet conditions, a label only, irrelevant, and purpose condition. In the label only condition, a name was only given to the target item. In the irrelevant condition, the target item was given a label and inductively irrelevant information, such as that it gets wet when it rains.  The taxonomic match was given the same inductively irrelevant information as the target. The shape match was given different irrelevant information. The purpose condition was similar to the irrelevant condition, except that the items were given purposes.

## Experiment 2

This was the same as experiment 1 except that we examined how children extend words and categorize at the superordinate level. For instance, if the standard was a drum, and a foot stool was the shape shape, a saxophone would be shown as the taxonomic match. There were again three differnet conditions, a label only, irrelevant, and purpose condition.

Experiment 2 was run synchronously over Zoom.

Experiment 3 involved giving 5 - 9 year old children classic cases where objects, artifacts and animals, undergo radical perceptual transformation. In one conditon, children were given the standard version of this task, where something just undergoes radical change, like a bee being made to look like a spider. In the other, the purpose condition, children were told that the thing, after undergoing radical change, preserved its original purpose. For instance, if a bee was made to look like a spider, children would be told that the thing made honey. 

The materials we used in this experiment were detemrined by first running a two part norming study. In the first part, 4 - 6 year old children were asked what various artifacts and animals are for. We then selected some of the top artifacts and animals whose purpose they agreed on and used these in the second part.  In the second part, we gave 4 - 6 year old children artifact and animal pairs and asked which has some particular purpose. Children were overwhelmingly inclined to select the correct items when asked which of two had some particular purpose. From these, we selected four artifact and four biological kind pairs to be used for the transformations in Experiment 3.
