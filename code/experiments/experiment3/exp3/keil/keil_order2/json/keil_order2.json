Here we are studying how children categorize objects when their appearances are altered. Specifically, we want to know if knowing the purpose of an object affects how children categorize it. For example, if a hotplate looks like a clock after undergoing a change, but still only heats up and doesn't tell time, what do children think it is? Do they consider it a hotplate or a clock? Our focus is on human made objects like clocks and toasters, as well as living things that can move on their own, such as cats and fish. By doing this study, we hope to gain insights into the cognitive processes underlying children's categorization judgments. Although children’s answers can vary, there aren’t any “right” or “wrong” answers to the questions. We are just interested in looking at the average responses from children and we won’t take any specific answers as “good” or “bad”. \n\n If you are interested in learning more about this, please see the following experimental paper as <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cogs.12725' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here.</a> \n\n Thank you again for your participation! Gift cards will be sent within one week of study completion. Please note that we only offer Amazon.com gift card at this time, thanks for your understanding!",
